# **Unity Test Runner + AltUnity Tester**

This project is an example for testing a game using both Unity Test Framework and AltUnity Tester.

To run unit tests, open the Test Runner Editor Window by clicking Window->General->Test Runner. Select the "Run all" tab and check the test results.

To run AltUnity tests, open the AltUnity Tester Editor window from AltUnity Tools-> AltUnity Tester Editor. Make sure the "Editor" is selected in the Platform section, click on "Play in Editor" and once the game is started run the tests by selecting "Run all" or "Run Selected".
